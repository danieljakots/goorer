# Goorer

Goorer is a personal finance software. It's loosely based on
[poorer](https://framagit.org/Steap/poorer). Goorer is written in go â€” hence
the name, and has a CLI instead of a web one.

# Using goorer

## Installation

Get the reposity and run `make build`. It will produce the *goorer* binary.

## Goorer's data

Goorer gets its data from yaml files. There are two types of files:
- categories
- money exchanges

The *categories.yml* file is a key value file which is used only for spendings.
The key is who got your money, and the value is its categories.

An example could be:
~~~
rent: home
furniture shop: home
supermarket: food
restaurant: food
~~~

All entities need to have one category.

Money exchanges file are a file with the earnings and spendings listed. For
instance:
~~~
earnings:
- date: 2020-12-25
  amount: 4321
  with: Company
- date: 2020-12-25
  amount: 5
  with: Santa Claus

spendings:
- date: 2020-12-01
  amount: 1234
  with: rent
- date: 2020-12-12
  amount: 13.37
  with: cat food shop
- date: 2020-12-21
  amount: 73.31
  with: saq
- date: 2020-12-25
  amount: 42.24
  with: cat food shop
~~~

Poorer reads only files with the `.yaml` extension. To allow have both file in
the same directory, goorer reads only files with the `.yml` extension since the
format changes a bit. With sed(1) you can easily move from poorer to goorer,
you just need to search and replace `to:` and `from:` to `with:`.

## Usage

Here's how to use goorer:

~~~
$ goorer -h
usage: goorer [-h] {summary, earnings, spendings} path/to/data

Each subcommand accepts a --date YYYY[-MM] to filter on a subset of entries
The spendings subcommand accept a -d/--details. This prints spendings
~~~

Here's what it looks like:
(testdata is the directory with some data for unit tests).
